[**NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, Draft Version 800-181**](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-181/sp800_181_draft.pdf)

The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) was developed through a partnership between the NIST-led National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense. The NCWF functions as a blueprint to categorize, organize, and describe security work by defining Specialty Areas; Work Roles (new as of SP 800-181); Tasks; and Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs). In this way the NCWF functions as a security workforce dictionary of sorts at it creates a common lexicon for employers, educators, trainers, and those in the workforce to use to describe security work.  

When the new version of the NCWF is finalized mid-2017 we will be mapping all of our courses to the framework. In the meantime, weâ€™ll continue to use the NCWF to inform all information/cyber security curriculum plans.
